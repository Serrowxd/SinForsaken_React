WORK IN PROGRESS

## TODO

- Raider Cards should have a constant width, the image also shrinks and should be solid.

- Navigation breaks at lower viewports, this needs to be fixed as well.

- Add more stuff to the landing page, possibly a suggestion to visit the raider section, then some videos, possibly some of the MSPaint strats?

- Set color constants in `theme.js` for each class, deconstruct, then call them in props.

- Raider Profiles should map information for each raider to the defined props. Possibly by using a map from state, then storing the information for each raider in state?

- Raider images will break based on length of the name - there should be a set width to the name container so it doesn't automatically break.
